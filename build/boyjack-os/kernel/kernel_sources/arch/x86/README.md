## x86 Kernel Build and Configuration Guide

This guide provides instructions for building and configuring the Linux kernel for the x86 architecture, with support for both Intel and AMD processors.

## Prerequisites

Cross-compiler for x86:
x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc

Linux Kernel Source:
Clone the official Linux kernel repository or use your custom source.

## Building the Kernel

1. Clone the Kernel Source
   First, clone the kernel source:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
   cd linux
2. Configure the Kernel
   Use a default x86 configuration or create your own:
   '''bash
   make ARCH=x86 defconfig
3. Build the Kernel
   '''bash
   make ARCH=x86
4. Install the Kernel
   Install the built kernel:
   '''bash
   make install

## Custom Configuration for x86 Processors

This kernel supports optimizations for Intel and AMD processors. You can adjust the build configuration for specific processor features in the cpu/ folder.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the cross-compiler for x86 is properly installed.
If you encounter errors related to missing device tree files, make sure you have the correct files for x86 architecture.
